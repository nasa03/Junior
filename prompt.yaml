  There was an editing error, scrumbling things here.
  In docs/descriptor.md, fix "- installedTools: Allows to overwrite attributes in prompt.yaml or create prompt/attributeName.md with the content."!
  installedTools is not defined like this. It allows the user to mention his tools, e.g. when drawing. By default it is "npm, jq" The user can create prompt/installedTools.md to overwrite.
  What was the previous definition of installedTools is instead a separate topic, put it to a separate paragraph and reword it: That the user can overwrite attributes in prompt.yaml or create prompt/attributeName.md with the content for any attribute, including ones not listed here.
