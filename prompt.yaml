  Write docs about developing external projects with Junior to docs/usage.md and link it from _sidebar.md!
  Info to include (Also read README.md for what Junior is, but do not repeat much from it.):
  npm add @aijunior/dev --save-dev to install
  `npx junior-init` creates the necessary files in the repo.
  They are currently:
  ```
  ko@MacBook-Pro-5 x % npx junior-init
  Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/ko/projects-new/tmp/juniortest/x/.git/
  [master (root-commit) 5c5c155] Junior init
  2 files changed, 6 insertions(+)
  create mode 100644 .gitignore
  create mode 100644 prompt/projectSpecifics.md
  Repo initialized for Junior development
  ko@MacBook-Pro-5 x % ls -a
  .		..		.git		.gitignore	prompt		prompt.yaml
  ko@MacBook-Pro-5 x % ls -a prompt
  .			..			projectSpecifics.md
  ```
  The prompt files will be gitignored.
  prompt/projectSpecifics.md is for instructions about the codebase Junior working on, like the preferred tools.
  Note: projectSpecifics.md will be included in most prompts, so it adds complexity, which may result in the language model loosing track and failing to solve the task. So projectSpecifics.md should be kept minimal.
  `npx junior-web` starts Junior. Link web.md (We are using docsify!) for more info!
