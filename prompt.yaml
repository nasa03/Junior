  In docs/descriptor.md, instead of just "When a yaml attribute refers to an existing file, its content will be used.",
  make a whole section: "Attributes referencing .md files"!
  - Put it between "Attributes" and "Template Files"
  - Also write about an example in the new section: the task: prompt/task/feature/implement.md line in the example yaml
  - Show the content of prompt/task/feature/implement.md to supplement the example
