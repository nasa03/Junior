  Create docs/descriptor.md and link as "Prompt Descriptor" from _sidebar.md
  README.md is for your reference, do not modify it.
  Present the info as an introduction with example and reference of attributes.
  Also incorporate the followings:
  - "format:" is optional and half-working, it should be avoided for now. (Remove "format:" from the introductory example!)
  - "os:" is by default: "Debian".
  - "installedTools:""
  - Overwrite attributes in prompt.yaml or create prompt/attributeName.md with the content
  - Prompt parts are markdown template files, ejs runs on them (also link ejs)
  - Attributes from the yaml file are available in the template, e.g. `<%= requirements %>` injects the requirements
  - When a yaml attribute refers to an existing file, it's content will be used.
