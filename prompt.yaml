  Improve the roadmap!

  Usability & fixes details: We will implement the four buttons and fix every
  major bug and write docs to allow using Junior for developing external
  projects.

  Programming on mobile: We need a file browser to allow the user to select
  attention files from mobile. Then we will create an app by wrapping the
  frontend and test it by developing at the local Playground and while
  commuting.

  Auto-attention: Based on the requirements and task the user selected, we will
  propose an attention. We need to embed every file in the project and store the
  embeddings in an (embedded) vector database

  Prompt-herds (rename it!): Prompt herds will scan and transform (refactor) the
  codebase gradually

  Do not change the readme, just read it!
