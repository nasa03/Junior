  When talking about gitignored files,
  instead of "prompt files" we should say something like "Xx files".
  Find the best word to grasp them!
  Forget file names, their content follows:
    - .yaml is input by user
    - .md is debug info: AI prompt formatted as markdown
    - .sh is changeset packaged as executable, created by AI
  What kind of files are they?
  Fill in Xx!
