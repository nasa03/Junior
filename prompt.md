# Developing External Projects with Junior

## Installation

Install Junior as a development dependency by running the following command:

```
npm add @aijunior/dev --save-dev
```

## Initialization

You can initialize the necessary files in the repository with the command:

```
npx junior-init
```

This will create the following files:

```
.gitignore
prompt/projectSpecifics.md
prompt.yaml
```

The Task Interaction Files (TIF) will be gitignored:
  - `prompt.yaml`, the prompt descriptor filled by the user ([descriptor.md](./descriptor.md))
  - `prompt.md`, the generated prompt by Junior
  - `change.sh`, the changeset generated by the language model

### Project Specifics

`prompt/projectSpecifics.md` is used to provide instructions about the codebase that Junior is working on, like preferred tools. It is important to keep this file minimal as it will be included in most prompts, and unnecessary complexity may result in the language model losing track and failing to solve the task.

## Starting Junior

You can start Junior with:

```
npx junior-web
```

For more information about the web interface, please refer to [web.md](./web.md).

# Task

Implement the following feature!

- Create a plan!
- Create new files when needed!

Requirements:

- Add the sentence &#34;Additionally, you can install the &#34;Junior&#34; vscode extension from the vscode extension marketplace.&#34; to the installation section.



## Project Specifics

- Every js file should *only export a single function*!
- Use *ES6 imports*!
- Prefer *async/await* over promises!
- The frontend uses *Solidjs*, edit .jsx file accordingly


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
