*"Video: Junior codes itself"*
## Description

Junior is an exploratory project aimed at revolutionizing the way programmers interact with the development process. Just like how Linus Torvalds oversees the Linux Kernel development without coding himself, this project allows developers to communicate with the AI and supervise the development process.

Isn't that already possible with ChatGPT? No, LLMs have very limited "working memory", so it is not possible to directly work with them on large codebases.

By providing specific task details in a prompt descriptor and highlighting the relevant parts of your project, you can delegate code implementation, documentation, testing, and more to your AI Junior.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install, clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory. Additionally, you can install the "Junior" vscode extension from the vscode extension marketplace.

### Usage

#### Web Interface

Run the application with `npm start` to start a local server, where you can generate a prompt and automatically copy it to paste into ChatGPT. The web interface is designed for use with ChatGPT Pro and doesn't require an API key. For more information about the web interface, please refer to [docs/web.md](docs/web.md).

#### Command-line interface (CLI)

To start the CLI, use `npm run cli`. This mode uses the ChatGPT API, and you'll need an API key stored in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### The Prompt Descriptor

A prompt descriptor is a YAML file (`prompt.yaml`) outlining the details necessary for generating a task prompt for the AI model.

Here's an example of a prompt descriptor:

```yaml
task: prompt/task/feature/implement.md
attention:
  - src/interactiveSession/startInteractiveSession.js
  - src/prompt/createPrompt.js
  - src/attention/readAttention.js
  - prompt.yaml
requirements: >
  Write a README.md for this _exploratory_ project!
format: prompt/format/new_file_version.md
```

Each element in the descriptor serves a specific purpose:
- `task`: Describes the task type and scope. For example, `feature/implement`, `bug/fix`, or `refactor/`. You can check out the [prompt/task/feature/implement.md](prompt/task/feature/implement.md) file as an example.
- `attention`: Lists the files and directories most relevant to the task.
- `requirements`: Describes the actual task in a human-readable format.
- `format`: Determines how the output will be formatted.

### Attention Mechanism

The attention mechanism guides the AI model by providing it with a working set. It helps overcome the limited working memory of large language models.

The working set is a subset of the entire project that's currently in focus. It includes both files and directories. For files, the content is directly provided to the AI. For directories, a brief list of files and subdirectories within them is presented.

## Contributing and Support

Contributions are welcome! Remember, we eat our own dog food in this project. Junior is designed to write itself. Your main role will be to oversee the work, provide detailed prompts, and review the outcomes.

For support, please create an issue in the GitHub repository.

**Note:** For meaningful results, it's recommended to use the GPT-4 model or a more recent version.

# Developing External Projects with Junior

## Installation

Install Junior as a development dependency by running the following command:

```
npm add @aijunior/dev --save-dev
```

## Initialization

You can initialize the necessary files in the repository with the command:

```
npx junior-init
```

This will create the following files:

```
.gitignore
prompt/projectSpecifics.md
prompt.yaml
```

The prompt files will be gitignored:
  - `prompt.yaml`, the prompt descriptor filled by the user ([link to descriptor.md](./descriptor.md))
  - `prompt.md`, the generated prompt by Junior
  - `change.sh`, the changeset generated by the language model

### Project Specifics

`prompt/projectSpecifics.md` is used to provide instructions about the codebase that Junior is working on, like preferred tools. It is important to keep this file minimal as it will be included in most prompts, and unnecessary complexity may result in the language model losing track and failing to solve the task.

## Starting Junior

You can start Junior with:

```
npx junior-web
```

For more information about the web interface, please refer to [web.md](./web.md).

# Task

Improve the documentation!

When talking about gitignored files, instead of &#34;prompt files&#34; we should say something like &#34;Xx files&#34;. Find the best word to grasp them! Forget file names, their content follows:
  - .yaml is input by user
  - .md is debug info: AI prompt formatted as markdown
  - .sh is changeset packaged as executable, created by AI
What kind of files are they? Fill in Xx!


# Output Format

Encode and enclose your results as ./change.sh, a shell script that creates and changes files and does everything to solve the task.
Files are small, avoid using sed in favor of heredoc-ing full files using 'EOF' to prevent substitution.

OS: OSX

Installed tools: npm, jq


Do NOT write any text outside the script!

EXAMPLE START

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -e
goal=[Task description, max 7 words]
echo "Plan:"
echo "1. [...]"
[Commands solving the task]
echo "\033[32mDone: $goal\033[0m\n"
```
