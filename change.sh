## Project Description

Hey, Contributor!

Interpret issues freely. Need help or have ideas? Comment right here. Remember, this is the only forum where KrisztiÃ¡n answers questions - your golden ticket to help!

**Note**: We eat our own dog food. We use Junior to work on Junior. So please, commit prompt.yaml, prompt.md, and change.sh as part of your contribution.

Keep it friendly, that's our vibe.

Happy contributing!
